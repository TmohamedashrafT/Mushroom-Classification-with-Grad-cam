# Mushroom-Classification-with-Grad-cam
This repository aims to implement a mushroom type classifier using PyTorch, utilizing various models to enhance performance. Additionally, the project includes an analysis of the model's performance using Gradient-Class Activation Map (Grad-CAM) visualization.

# Dataset
The dataset was obtained from Kaggle, specifically from the "LOVE OF A LIFETIME" collection. It consists of nine classes of mushrooms, which were downloaded from Kaggle and then split into train (65%), validation (20%), and test (15%) sets. The split was done equally among the classes.
